# PHP Weather Forecast
Using PHP and regular expression to pull information off of weather-forcast.com

This app was built using PHP, jQuery and Bootstrap to display the current weather when the user enters a city. The PHP script uses the file_get_contents() method and the preg_match() method to pull specific information off of weather-forecast.com using a GET request.
